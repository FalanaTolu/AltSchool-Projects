# SchoolStat

## A simple dashboard for a tech school

You have data about which instructors are taking the courses in a school, as well as
data about which students are in the frontend, backend or cloud tracks. Your users need
to see some basic stats about the school

## Outcome

When the user opens the dashboard app, they see HTML tables showing the following
statistics/summaries:

- How many courses a given instructor is taking

- How many students are in each of the tracks (frontend, backend and cloud)

- How many students are male, female or other genders/orientation

- Minimum, maximum, and average age of students in the school

Additional  features:

- Make the tables sortable by (at least) the column holding the numbers. Indicate
what columns are sortable (e.g with an icon or by adding the <> characters in the
column header e.t.c). When the user clicks on a sortable column header, sort the
records in the table by that column (e.g switch the current sort order such that if
the column was already sorted ASC, sort in DESC
