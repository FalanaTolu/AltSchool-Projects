# Redactr

## Scramble some words from a body of text content

This app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions
of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste the some
content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using
another field). Note the user is allowed to specify more than one word (separated by
space) to be scrambled.

## Outcome

After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and
replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ***)

Additional features:

1. Allows the user specify what to use in replacing the words, so that the app can do
the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, questions marks,
dashes, underscores, or even other words

2. Displays some stats like how many words were scanned, how many matched the
words to be scrambled, how many characters were scrambled in total, how long
it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task
