# Github App

This app displays the user's Github profile information. This was achieved by fetching data containing the details of the user's Github account from the Github API.

The information displayed includes the user's repositories, the user's most recent activities, a snapshot of Github accounts following the user and accounts the user follows.

Only information available publicly through the Github API was used.

The App is hosted here on [Netlify](https://magnificent-meringue-767508.netlify.app/)
