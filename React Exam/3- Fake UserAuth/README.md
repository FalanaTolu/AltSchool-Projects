# Context API

This app sets up fake userAuthContext using the context API to always carry out a fake authentication and extracts out the currently logged-in user using a custom hook.

The default fake username and password used for authentication are "Tolu" and "12345". New ones can be created on the registration page.

The dashboard displays a mock sortable table of subscribers using the randomuser.me api in the dashboard.

The App is hosted here on [Netlify](https://tangerine-pika-8bffea.netlify.app)
